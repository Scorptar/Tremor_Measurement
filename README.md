# Description

Tremor Measurement using ADXL362 accelerometers controlled by an Arduino (ATmega328p) + data acquisition on PC through serial port (USB).

# Application

Tremor Measurement is a low-budget solution to measure tremor in the medical field (Parkinson,...)

# Principle

Tremor diseases typically make 1-30 Hz signal measured using accelerometers (1 to 5 sensors)

# Software

TM.py is runned on the PC : the program make a 30,60,90,120,150 seconds analysis and output an average FFT from the different sensors. Then, the user can generate a PDF with the results.
